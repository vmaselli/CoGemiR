=head1 NAME

Bio::Location::WidestCoordPolicy - class implementing 
Bio::Location::CoordinatePolicy as the widest possible and reasonable range

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See Bio::Location::CoordinatePolicyI

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CoordinatePolicyI implementing objects are used by Bio::LocationI
implementing objects to determine integer-valued coordinates when
asked for it.

This class will compute the coordinates such that always the widest possible
range is returned, but by using some common sense. This means that e.g.
locations like "E<lt>5..100" (start before position 5) will return 5 as start
(returned values have to be positive integers).

  Title   : start
  Usage   : $start = $policy->start($location);
  Function: Get the integer-valued start coordinate of the given location as
            computed by this computation policy.
  Returns : A positive integer number.
  Args    : A Bio::LocationI implementing object.

=cut

sub start {
    my ($self,$loc) = @_;

    # For performance reasons we don't check that it's indeed a Bio::LocationI
    # object. Hopefully, Location-object programmers are smart enough.
    my $pos = $loc->min_start();
    # if min is not defined or equals 0 we resort to max
    $pos = $loc->max_start() if(! $pos);
    return $pos;
}

=head2 end

  Title   : end
  Usage   : $end = $policy->end($location);
  Function: Get the integer-valued end coordinate of the given location as
            computed by this computation policy.
  Returns : A positive integer number.
  Args    : A Bio::LocationI implementing object.

    # For performance reasons we don't check that it's indeed a Bio::LocationI
    # object. Hopefully, Location-object programmers are smart enough.
