The Bioperl Blast module provides an API to the BLAST program, and
thereby permits the parsing, running, HTML-formatting, and general
manipulation of Blast data by simple method calls on Perl objects. 
It does not implement the Blast algorithm itself, relying on external
applications for this compute-intensive operation.

Bio::Tools::Blast.pm is the central "brain" module. It makes use of
other modules in the Bio/Tools/Blast/ directory. Bio::Tools:Blast.pm
is the only module you need to import into your namespace for working
with Blast reports.

Documentation and usage information about Blast.pm is contained in the
module itself. Run Blast.pm through pod2html (preferably from Perl
v5.004 or later) and view the resulting output with a web
browser. Other modules in the hierarchy are similarly documented but
Blast.pm contains the main documentation.

On-line docs can be found at http://bio.perl.org/Projects/Blast/
